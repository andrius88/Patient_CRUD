### Patient CRUD <br />

This program was made as one assignment of the course "Programing practice" while I was studying computer science <br />
at "Vilniaus Kolegija" - University of Applied Sciences.
The program was written using C++ procedural language.
Data of all patients is read from txt file and loaded into RAM.
User can view list of patients add a patient, modify data of patient, search for some patient, calculate <br />
mass index, delete patient and save all data from RAM to the file.
